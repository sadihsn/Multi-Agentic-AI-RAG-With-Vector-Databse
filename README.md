# Multi-Agentic-AI-RAG-With-Vector-Database
This project demonstrates the integration of Multi-Agentic AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database to create intelligent, data-driven systems. The system is designed to efficiently retrieve, process, and generate context-aware responses by utilizing the power of multiple AI agents working in parallel. 

You can install all dependencies by running:
